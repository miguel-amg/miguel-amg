# About me:
I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Software Engineering at University of Minho, specializing in Cryptography and Information Security (CSI) and Software Development, Validation, and Maintenance (SDVM). 

I enjoy working in teams and approach challenges with an organized, methodical, and creative mindset. I am always eager to learn new things and adapt to different languages and tools as needed. 

On a personal level, I am a positive and optimistic person who wants to contribute to making the world a better place through technology. Outside of my professional interests, I also have a deep passion for music and enjoy playing in a band, where I explore creativity and artistic expression.
